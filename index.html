			<h3>What I'm About</h3>
      
      <p>In High school I worked with PhotoShop, Adobe Illustrator, and worked with Video editor and video recording. Video tech is another passion of mine. In High School I was part of a news group called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MustangReport/videos">Mustang Report</a>, I love every minute of it, from editing the videos to filming my team! Even got third place in a video competition for the whole GISD by posting a video about mental abuse.</p>

      <p>Although I love making videos and filming, coding is the peanut butter to my jelly. If I had to put a list together on what I love about coding is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>It's like putting a puzzle together and a language.</li>
        <li>Love being part of a team, so being able to work with people together on a project is an honor and interesting, especially seeing and hearing other peoples ideas and/or perspective</li>
        <li>I'm using the skills I know to make me my very own website for my video projeccts.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So all together...definitely a beautifully sweet deal!</p>
